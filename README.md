# Pig Game

## How to Play

Pig Game is a simple dice game where players take turns rolling a dice and accumulating points. The objective is to be the first player to reach 100 points. Here are the rules:

1. Each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as they want. The dice roll result is added to their current score.

2. If a player rolls a 1, their current score is lost, and it becomes the other player's turn.

3. Instead of rolling again, a player can choose to "hold" their current score. The current score is added to their total score, and it becomes the other player's turn.

4. The game continues with players taking turns until one of them reaches 100 points. That player is declared the winner.

## Practicing Objectives

The Pig Game project provides an opportunity to practice the following concepts:

1. **Event Handlers**: Learn how to handle user interactions, such as clicking a button to roll the dice or hold the current score.

2. **Manipulating Styles**: Explore how to dynamically update the styles of elements based on game conditions or user actions, such as highlighting the current player or displaying a winning message.

3. **Scoping**: Understand how to manage variables and their scope within the game logic, ensuring that the game state is correctly maintained and updated.

4. **Looping and Selecting Elements with the Same Class**: Practice using JavaScript to loop through and select multiple elements with the same class, such as the dice images or player scores, for manipulation or updates during the game.
